# Basic Portfolio Project

Created as a project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program by yours truly, Macy McGahee.


## Information / Details

This was one of my very first projects that I created for my Nanodegree. I learned quite a bit about CSS3 and HTML5 while working my way through this project. I also learned how to successfully replicate a design mockup of a website. The design mockup is included in a PDF file named portfolio-design-mockup. Upon opening this project you'll be able to see that I'm a cat lady at heart. But the neat thing about this project is that it works as a great basic portfolio site template that can be changed and manipulated easily. In fact, my main [portfolio site](https://www.macymcgahee.com), is created from this project.


## Usage

Download and unzip basic-portfolio-project-udacity. Open index.html in your browser of choice. Each Project (cat) icon can be clicked on which will open a small window that displays an image along with a corresponding description.
